<br>

Welcome! The goal of this site is to make my code and projects accessible to other R enthusiasts, from beginners to potential employers. If enjoy my work, there's more of it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rbkeeney); and, if you have a question or comment my DMs are open.

If you'd like to support my work, [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rbkeeney) is currently the best place. Once you're a member, you'll get access to NFL Analytics and Fantasy football resources such as:

-   Multiple Shiny Web Apps
-   Rookie Projections and Models
-   Twitch Live-Streams
-   Rookie and Player Ranks
-   Playbooks for Redraft and Dynasty Leagues
-   Curated Databases for Additional Analysis

### Special thanks to [Danielle Navarro](https://twitter.com/djnavarro) for the Hugo theme and R package.
